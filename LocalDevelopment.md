# Local development
It is desirable to have Local development as closely similar to production as possible.

## Local MySQL server
docker-compose.yml

## Dockworker

https://github.com/unb-libraries/dockworker

Dockworker is a custom library that provides a series of RoboPHP commands which simplify the local deployment process for developers. Start development quickly with :

```
> composer install
> dockworker instance:start
```
